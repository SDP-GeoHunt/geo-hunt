The GeoHunt project is an Android game developed in Kotlin that encourages users to explore new locations
by taking pictures of their surroundings and challenging other users to find and reach the location
where the picture was taken. Users can register and create their account, take pictures and upload them
to the game's server, view a list of their active challenges, and view the leaderboard to see who has the
most points. The game is designed to be fun, interactive, and engaging, and to provide users with an opportunity
to discover new places and environments while enjoying a game. Overall, the GeoHunt project is a unique and
innovative way to explore the world around us while having fun with other players.


## How to Play

### Solo gameplay

1. Users take a picture of their current location and upload it to the game's server.
2. Other users must find and go to the location where the picture was taken and claim the challenge.
3. The closer the user gets to the actual location, the higher the points they earn.
4. Users can view the game's leaderboard to see who has the most points.

### Team gameplay

Bounties are a collection of challenges that players can solve in a team. Very similar to the solo
gameplay except that everything is done as a team.

For every bounty, an administrator is responsible for creating challenges.
